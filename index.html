    No matter what way you look at it, if you want to get laid you have to put your balls on the table and just do it. What I mean by this is you HAVE to take risks. You HAVE to take a chance. You may not be comfortable doing something, or saying something, but the fact that you are doing it is making it more likely for you to get laid. For example, let's say you go to a club. What's stopping you from letting loose and having fun. What's stopping you from going up to that cute girl by the bar and chatting with her. Maybe she's with a friend and they both look really cute. Nothing is stopping you. You can choose to walk up there to her and start talking. You have to be willing to not give any fucks as well. I want you to just try this at one point in your life: go up to a girl at a bar who you think is cute, sit down next to her and just start talking. Most of you probably can't do something like this. Ask yourself, why can't you do this? You talk to people everyday correct? I'm assuming you have some social interaction. I'm assuming you have some sense of humor or even know how to carry a conversation with like your boss or something. All you need to do is apply these skills to the conversation with this girl at the bar. That's half of it. The other half is physically walking over and sitting down. Why is something like this so hard to do? Stop giving a fuck about being judged, about being rejected, and about everything else. Get a friend to come out with you and tell him to throw you in set or start punching the shit out of you until you start walking and approach. All it takes is your will power to not give any fucks and just do it. That's all it takes.</p>
